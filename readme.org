* Intro
  <2017-09-25 Mon> This repository contains all the files used for
  designing, building and playing the sponge.  This version is for the
  new sponge quintet.  The sponges are based on the Adafruit Feather
  M0 WiFi (with ATWINC1500 wifi chip).

* Instructions 
  Instructions on how to use the sponge with your comupter are in
  =scCode/instructions.org= or =scCode/instructions.pdf= .  They are
  in French only at this point.
